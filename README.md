# AI-Assisted Development Template

> **Note**: This README is provided as a starting point for your project. Feel free to edit or remove it entirely once you've initialized your own project.

## 🎯 What Is This?

This is a **template repository for AI-assisted development projects**. It provides a structured foundation for building software with AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude, or other agentic tools. The template includes pre-configured commands and workflows that help you maintain project context, manage AI agents, and keep documentation synchronized with your evolving codebase.

## ✨ What You Get

### Pre-configured Cursor Commands

This template includes powerful Cursor commands in `.cursor/commands/`:

1. **`/init`** - Initialize your project with comprehensive context documentation
   - Automatically scans your project structure
   - Discovers and catalogs all AI agents
   - Generates living documentation (AGENTS.md)
   - Sets up auto-maintenance rules
   - Creates a complete context map for AI assistants

2. **`/create-agent`** - Scaffold new AI agents with best practices
   - Creates properly structured agent files
   - Includes role definitions and capabilities
   - Sets up tool permissions
   - Defines communication styles
   - Provides example invocations

### Living Documentation System

The template introduces the concept of **AGENTS.md** - a comprehensive, auto-maintained document that serves as the single source of truth for:

- Project overview and technology stack
- All AI agents and their capabilities
- Development conventions and patterns
- Architectural decisions
- Testing strategies
- Common workflows
- Dependency context

Unlike traditional README files that quickly become outdated, AGENTS.md stays synchronized with your codebase through automatic maintenance rules.

### Agent-Ready Structure

The template expects (and the commands will create) these directories:

```
your-project/
├── .cursor/
│   ├── agents/          # Cursor AI agents
│   ├── commands/        # Custom Cursor commands (like /init)
│   └── rules/           # Auto-maintenance rules
├── .agents/             # Generic agent storage
├── agents/              # Project-specific agents
├── docs/                # Additional documentation
└── AGENTS.md            # Living context document (generated by /init)
```

## 🏁 Getting Started

### 1. Use This Template

Click "Use this template" on GitHub, or clone it:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> my-project
cd my-project
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project

Open the project in Cursor and run:

```
/init
```

This will:
- Scan your project structure
- Generate AGENTS.md with complete context
- Set up auto-maintenance rules
- Create a foundation for AI-assisted development

**Options:**
```
/init scan_depth:deep include_dependencies:true auto_watch:true
```

### 3. Start Building

Begin developing your project with AI assistance. The agents and context system will help your AI assistant understand your project better over time.

### 4. Create Custom Agents (Optional)

As your project grows, create specialized agents:

```
/create-agent
```

This will guide you through creating purpose-built agents for specific tasks like testing, refactoring, documentation, or domain-specific operations.

## 📚 Core Concepts

### What Are AI Agents?

In this context, agents are **specialized AI assistants** with:
- Defined roles and responsibilities
- Specific tool access and permissions
- Communication styles tailored to their purpose
- Constraints and boundaries
- Integration points with your codebase

### Why Living Documentation?

Traditional documentation suffers from **drift** - the gap between what's documented and what's real. This template solves that by:

1. **Automatic scanning** - Discovers the actual state of your project
2. **Trigger-based updates** - Detects when context changes
3. **Structured maintenance** - Updates only relevant sections
4. **Version tracking** - Records significant changes

### The Agent Ecosystem

Instead of a single generic AI assistant, you can build an **ecosystem of specialized agents**:

- **Code Review Agent** - Focuses on quality, patterns, and conventions
- **Testing Agent** - Specializes in test creation and coverage
- **Documentation Agent** - Maintains docs and comments
- **Refactoring Agent** - Improves structure while preserving behavior
- **Debug Agent** - Traces issues and suggests fixes

Each agent has context about your project through AGENTS.md, but specialized knowledge for their domain.

## 🎨 Customization

### Adapting the Template

This is a **starting point**, not a rigid framework. Customize it to your needs:

- **Modify commands** - Edit `.cursor/commands/*.md` to match your workflow
- **Adjust structure** - Add or remove sections from the AGENTS.md template
- **Configure auto-watch** - Change what triggers documentation updates
- **Create agents** - Build agents specific to your domain or tech stack
- **Remove what you don't need** - Not using agents? Delete those directories

### Language/Framework Specific

While the template is language-agnostic, you can tailor it:

```
# For React projects
- Add component patterns to conventions
- Document state management approaches
- Include styling guidelines

# For Python projects  
- Add type hinting standards
- Document virtual environment setup
- Include import organization rules

# For backend services
- Document API design patterns
- Include database migration strategies
- Add deployment procedures
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Multiple Agent Teams

For large projects, organize agents into teams:

```
.cursor/agents/
├── frontend/
│   ├── component-agent.md
│   └── styling-agent.md
├── backend/
│   ├── api-agent.md
│   └── database-agent.md
└── devops/
    ├── deployment-agent.md
    └── monitoring-agent.md
```

### Integration with CI/CD

Run the context compiler in your pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Action
- name: Update Project Context
  run: cursor-cli run /init scan_depth:deep
```

### Cross-Project Agents

Share agents across projects:

```bash
# Symlink shared agents
ln -s ~/shared-agents/code-reviewer.md .cursor/agents/
```

## 🤔 When to Use This Template

**Good Fit:**
- ✅ Projects with AI-assisted development
- ✅ Teams wanting consistent AI interactions
- ✅ Codebases where context matters
- ✅ Projects that need living documentation
- ✅ When onboarding new developers (human or AI)

**Maybe Not:**
- ❌ Tiny scripts or one-off projects
- ❌ Projects without AI assistant usage
- ❌ When documentation is not a priority
- ❌ Extremely simple codebases

## 🤝 Contributing to the Template

This template itself can evolve. Consider contributing:

- New useful commands
- Agent templates for common scenarios
- Improved documentation structures
- Integration with other AI tools
- Best practices and patterns

## 📖 Philosophy

This template embodies several principles:

1. **Context is King** - AI assistants are only as good as their context
2. **Documentation Must Live** - Static docs die; maintain them automatically
3. **Specialization > Generalization** - Purpose-built agents outperform generic ones
4. **Convention > Configuration** - Sensible defaults with escape hatches
5. **Evolve with Your Project** - The system grows as complexity grows

### AGENTS.md Not Updating

Check that auto-watch is enabled and the cursor rule is in `.cursor/rules/agents-maintainer.md`.

### Too Much/Too Little Context

Adjust the `scan_depth` parameter when running `/init`:
- `shallow` - Fast, less detail
- `medium` - Balanced (default)
- `deep` - Comprehensive, slower
