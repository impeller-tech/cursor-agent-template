# AI-Assisted Development Template

> **Note**: This README is provided as a starting point for your project. Feel free to edit or remove it entirely once you've initialized your own project.

## 🎯 What Is This?

This is a **template repository for AI-assisted development projects**. It provides a structured foundation for building software with AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude, or other agentic tools. The template includes pre-configured commands and workflows that help you maintain project context, manage AI agents, and keep documentation synchronized with your evolving codebase.

## ✨ What You Get

### Pre-configured Cursor Commands

This template includes powerful Cursor commands in `.cursor/commands/`:

1. **`/init`** - Initialize your project with comprehensive context documentation
   - Automatically scans your project structure
   - Discovers and catalogs all AI agents
   - Generates living documentation (AGENTS.md)
   - Sets up auto-maintenance rules
   - Creates a complete context map for AI assistants

2. **`/create-agent`** - Scaffold new AI agents with best practices
   - Creates properly structured agent files
   - Includes role definitions and capabilities
   - Sets up tool permissions
   - Defines communication styles
   - Provides example invocations

3. **`/new-skill`** - Create Cursor skills integrated with the project ecosystem
   - Creates skills following Cursor's best practices
   - Automatically registers skills in AGENTS.md
   - Supports both project and personal skill locations
   - Integrates with template's documentation system
   - Provides template-specific guidance and examples

### Living Documentation System

The template introduces the concept of **AGENTS.md** - a comprehensive, auto-maintained document that serves as the single source of truth for:

- Project overview and technology stack
- All AI agents and their capabilities
- Cursor skills and their purposes
- Development conventions and patterns
- Architectural decisions
- Testing strategies
- Common workflows
- Dependency context

Unlike traditional README files that quickly become outdated, AGENTS.md stays synchronized with your codebase through automatic maintenance rules.

### Agent-Ready Structure

The template expects (and the commands will create) these directories:

```
your-project/
├── .cursor/
│   ├── agents/          # Cursor AI agents
│   ├── commands/        # Custom Cursor commands (like /init)
│   ├── skills/          # Cursor skills (project-specific)
│   └── rules/           # Auto-maintenance rules
├── .agents/             # Generic agent storage
├── agents/              # Project-specific agents
├── docs/                # Additional documentation
└── AGENTS.md            # Living context document (generated by /init)
```

## 🏁 Getting Started

### 1. Use This Template

Click "Use this template" on GitHub, or clone it:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> my-project
cd my-project
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project

Open the project in Cursor and run:

```
/init
```

This will:
- Scan your project structure
- Generate AGENTS.md with complete context
- Set up auto-maintenance rules
- Create a foundation for AI-assisted development

**Options:**
```
/init scan_depth:deep include_dependencies:true auto_watch:true
```

### 3. Start Building

Begin developing your project with AI assistance. The agents and context system will help your AI assistant understand your project better over time.

### 4. Create Custom Agents (Optional)

As your project grows, create specialized agents:

```
/create-agent
```

This will guide you through creating purpose-built agents for specific tasks like testing, refactoring, documentation, or domain-specific operations.

### 5. Create Custom Skills (Optional)

Create Cursor skills that integrate with your project:

```
/new-skill skill_name:code-review purpose:"Review code following project conventions"
```

This creates skills that are automatically documented in AGENTS.md and follow your project's patterns. Skills teach the AI how to perform specific tasks, while agents are specialized assistants with defined roles.

## 📚 Core Concepts

### What Are AI Agents?

In this context, agents are **specialized AI assistants** with:
- Defined roles and responsibilities
- Specific tool access and permissions
- Communication styles tailored to their purpose
- Constraints and boundaries
- Integration points with your codebase

### Why Living Documentation?

Traditional documentation suffers from **drift** - the gap between what's documented and what's real. This template solves that by:

1. **Automatic scanning** - Discovers the actual state of your project
2. **Trigger-based updates** - Detects when context changes
3. **Structured maintenance** - Updates only relevant sections
4. **Version tracking** - Records significant changes

### The Agent Ecosystem

Instead of a single generic AI assistant, you can build an **ecosystem of specialized agents**:

- **Code Review Agent** - Focuses on quality, patterns, and conventions
- **Testing Agent** - Specializes in test creation and coverage
- **Documentation Agent** - Maintains docs and comments
- **Refactoring Agent** - Improves structure while preserving behavior
- **Debug Agent** - Traces issues and suggests fixes

Each agent has context about your project through AGENTS.md, but specialized knowledge for their domain.

## 🎨 Customization

### Adapting the Template

This is a **starting point**, not a rigid framework. Customize it to your needs:

- **Modify commands** - Edit `.cursor/commands/*.md` to match your workflow
- **Adjust structure** - Add or remove sections from the AGENTS.md template
- **Configure auto-watch** - Change what triggers documentation updates
- **Create agents** - Build agents specific to your domain or tech stack
- **Create skills** - Build skills for specific tasks or workflows
- **Remove what you don't need** - Not using agents? Delete those directories

### Language/Framework Specific

While the template is language-agnostic, you can tailor it:

```
# For React projects
- Add component patterns to conventions
- Document state management approaches
- Include styling guidelines

# For Python projects  
- Add type hinting standards
- Document virtual environment setup
- Include import organization rules

# For backend services
- Document API design patterns
- Include database migration strategies
- Add deployment procedures
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Multiple Agent Teams

For large projects, organize agents into teams:

```
.cursor/agents/
├── frontend/
│   ├── component-agent.md
│   └── styling-agent.md
├── backend/
│   ├── api-agent.md
│   └── database-agent.md
└── devops/
    ├── deployment-agent.md
    └── monitoring-agent.md
```

### Integration with CI/CD

Run the context compiler in your pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Action
- name: Update Project Context
  run: cursor-cli run /init scan_depth:deep
```

### Cross-Project Agents

Share agents across projects:

```bash
# Symlink shared agents
ln -s ~/shared-agents/code-reviewer.md .cursor/agents/
```

## 🤔 When to Use This Template

**Good Fit:**
- ✅ Projects with AI-assisted development
- ✅ Teams wanting consistent AI interactions
- ✅ Codebases where context matters
- ✅ Projects that need living documentation
- ✅ When onboarding new developers (human or AI)

**Maybe Not:**
- ❌ Tiny scripts or one-off projects
- ❌ Projects without AI assistant usage
- ❌ When documentation is not a priority
- ❌ Extremely simple codebases

## 🤝 Contributing to the Template

This template itself can evolve. Consider contributing:

- New useful commands
- Agent templates for common scenarios
- Improved documentation structures
- Integration with other AI tools
- Best practices and patterns

## 📖 Philosophy

This template embodies several principles:

1. **Context is King** - AI assistants are only as good as their context
2. **Documentation Must Live** - Static docs die; maintain them automatically
3. **Specialization > Generalization** - Purpose-built agents outperform generic ones
4. **Convention > Configuration** - Sensible defaults with escape hatches
5. **Evolve with Your Project** - The system grows as complexity grows

### AGENTS.md Not Updating

Check that auto-watch is enabled and the cursor rule is in `.cursor/rules/agents-maintainer.md`.

### Too Much/Too Little Context

Adjust the `scan_depth` parameter when running `/init`:
- `shallow` - Fast, less detail
- `medium` - Balanced (default)
- `deep` - Comprehensive, slower
